Oh (Night of) Eid, you've delighted us and renewed our hope

Oh Eid, your (crescent) moon has appeared before our eyes
It filled us with happiness and we sang
And we said that happiness/fortune will come to us
Upon your arrival, oh Night of Eid

You've brought all the close friends back together
And the cup has passed among the companions 
(here nudaman should be a plural of nadim "drinking companion" or "close friend")
And the birds are singing in the trees to greet the dawn
Oh Night of Eid

As my beloved's ship sails, my soul travels on the wind
Tell him, my dear (literally, my pretty), it's early
Sleep is forbidden (haram) on the Night of Eid

Oh Nile, your waters are sweet
You spread light throughout the fields
May you live long and prosper, oh Nile
And enjoy many Nights of Eid
